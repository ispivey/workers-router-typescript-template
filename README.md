# Router

Selects the logic to respond to requests based on the `request` method and URL. Can be used with REST APIs or apps that require basic routing logic.

[`index.js`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template-router/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the Workers script.

Live Demos are hosted on `workers-tooling.cf/demos/router`:
[Demo /bar](http://workers-tooling.cf/demos/router/bar) | [Demo /foo](http://workers-tooling.cf/demos/router/foo)

## 🔋 Getting Started

This template is meant to be used with [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). If you are not already familiar with the tool, we recommend that you install the tool and configure it to work with your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Documentation can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/).

To generate using Wrangler, run this command:

```bash
wrangler generate my-app https://github.com/ispivey/worker-template-router-ts
```

## 👩 💻 Developing

[`src/index.js`](./src/index.ts) calls the request handler in [`src/handler.ts`](./src/handler.ts), and will return the [request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method) for the given request.

## 🧪 Testing

This template comes with mocha tests which simply test that the request handler can handle each request method. `npm test` will run your tests.

## ✏️ Formatting

This template uses [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to format the project. To invoke, run `npm run format`.

## 👀 Previewing and Publishing
